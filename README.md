## Hi devs, my name is Luis David Lopera! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a software developer specializing in JavaScript with a solid track record in creating attractive, functional, and high-performance user interfaces. I've worked on projects that stand out for their quality and efficiency, using modern technologies such as React, Next.js, Vite.js, MERN stack, Context API, Hooks, JWT, and Styled Components. My passion for UI/UX allows me to effectively collaborate with design teams to create products that offer an intuitive and engaging user experience.

## Currently

ðŸ”­ I'm focused on projects using Vite.js and Next.js, where I explore innovative solutions to improve the user experience.

ðŸŒ± Constantly learning, I'm currently delving into NestJS and Angular, expanding my knowledge in both frontend and backend technologies.

ðŸ˜„ I also have experience in .NET and SQL, which gives me a comprehensive perspective for full-stack development.
